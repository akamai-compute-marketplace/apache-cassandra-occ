## Cluster Deployment Architecture

Create a highly available Apache Cassandra cluster using through the Linode Marketplace. Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed NoSQL database management system designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low-latency operations for all clients. 

## Deploying a Marketplace App

{{% content "marketplace-verify-standard-shortguide" %}}

{{< note >}}
**Estimated deployment time:** Your Apache Cassandra cluster should be fully installed within 10-15 minutes after the Compute Instance has finished provisioning.
{{< /note >}}

## Configuration Options

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Suggested minimum plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used. For best results, use a minimum of 8GB Dedicated CPU or Shared Compute Instance is recommended. 

### Apache Cassandra Options

- **[Linode API Token](/docs/products/tools/api/guides/manage-api-tokens/#create-an-api-token):** The provisioner node will use an authenticated API token to create the additional components to the cluster. This is required to fully create the GlusterFS cluster.

{{% content "marketplace-special-character-limitations-shortguide" %}}

- **Cassandra Database User:** Enter your database super username for the Cassandra cluster

- **Number of clients connecting to Cassandra:** The number of clients that will be connecting to the cluster. The application will create SSL certificates for your client that need to connect to the cluster. This should be an interger equal or greater than 1.

- **Cassandra cluster size:** The size of the Cassandra cluster

- **Country or Region:** Enter the country or region for you or your organization.

- **State or Province:** Enter the state or province for you or your organization.

- **Locality:** Enter the town or other locality for you or your organization.

- **Organization:** Enter the name of your organization.

- **Email Address:** Enter the email address you wish to use for your certificate file.


## Getting Started After Deployment

Apache Cassandra is now installed and ready to use!

This playbook creates a 3-5 node cluster using Apache Cassandra. Authentication to the cluster is secured via a user-supplied username. The default `cassandra` database role is dropped and superseded by the new user role provided by the client. In addition, cluster communication is secured via SSL/TLS where keystores are created and used by the cluster.

Both certificates and keystores can be found on every node in the `/etc/cassandra/ssl` directory. Only the first Cassandra server will have client certificates. This playbook also creates *_n_* amount of client certificates so that applications can connect to the Cassandra cluster.

We can connect to Cassandra using `cqlsh` using client or server certificates. You will need 4 components in order to connect to the cluster:

- Username and password created by the playbook. You can find the credentials in '/home/admin/.credentials'. Assumming that you created a user called `admin'.
- Client certificate
- Client key
- CA certificate

To start, on the client node, create the following directory, `/home/admin/cassandra_ssl`.  In this example we are assuming that there is a system user called `admin`. 

Next, on the first Cassandra node, copy the content of `/etc/cassandra/ssl/cert/client1.crt`, `/etc/cassandra/ssl/cert/client1.crt` and `/etc/cassandra/ssl/ca/ca.crt` and place it in the `/home/admin/cassandra_ssl` we just created.

We will need to create a Cassandra resource file to use our client certificate. Create the the `/home/admin/.cassandra` directory. Create a file with the following contents:
```
[connection]
ssl = true
factory = cqlshlib.ssl.ssl_transport_factory
[ssl]
certfile = /home/admin/cassandra_ssl/ca.crt
userkey = /home/admin/cassandra_ssl/client1.key
usercert = /home/admin/cassandra_ssl/client1.crt
validate = true
```

Lastly, we connect to one of the Cassandra servers using `cqlsh`:

```
cqlsh 192.168.139.160 -u superuser --ssl
```

Please replace `192.168.139.160` with the private IP address of one of the Cassandra nodes and `superuser` with the user you provided at the start of the cluster. Once you are connected and enter the password at prompt, you have authenticated to the cluster!

```
Connected to Cassandra Cluster at 192.168.139.160:9042
[cqlsh 6.1.0 | Cassandra 4.1.5 | CQL spec 3.4.6 | Native protocol v5]
Use HELP for help.
superadmin@cqlsh>
```

You can distribute the remainder of client certifcates to the remainder of the nodes. Enjoy!
